***
Run Test1.m 
***
The assumptions made are:
1. The world extends from -WorldLim to WorldLim in both X and Y directions. Refer to [Test1.m](https://github.com/NitinJSanket/CMSC828THW1/blob/master/Test1.m) code
2. You have a noisy odometry estimate with noise covariance given by [0.3 0.3 0.1\].\*[MovementX MovementY MovementTheta]
3. The landmark noise is given by [0.1 0.1] in m
4. Obstacles are non blocking
5. Refer to math from slides
6. Cite GTSAM links from slides (1st and 2nd links) 
*** 
Talk to Kanishka and write the auto-grader instructions
